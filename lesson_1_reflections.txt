How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only shows the differences between each file and viewing side by side easier to spot a typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    You have a record of all changes to the file, helps debugging

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Manually commit is a conscious decision but you have to do it or lose your changes
    Auto commit easier but too many versions - no logical flow

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files may constitute one application, i.e. many modules, but docs are standalone

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    git log shows you the commit history of a repository. git diff show you file changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
You can always checkout a previous commit to find out when it last worked and then use git diff to see what broke

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Writing a small application, adding functionality incrementally
