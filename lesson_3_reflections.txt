When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repo is fault-tolerant and allows for collaboration
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  There may be multiple changes in the remote repository if other collaborators are working on it and you are only interested in the changes you are making
